# Hydra
asp .net MVC project

Description:
This project was designed and built by myself and one other developer. I did 90% of the coding, while the other developer was there to help me past a couple of roadbloacks along the way. I did not upload the web.config file, because it contains some AGS sensitive info. But web.config is used for most of the apps configuration settings.

The live version of this site is running via IIS webserver, and was published using a file system publish.

There is also a folder not uploaded, that contains windows batch files. These files do things such as connect to a server, access a file, parse it, and grab version info.
